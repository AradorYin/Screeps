This is my attempt at a Screeps colony automation. For those wondering how I got started, I followed the first video in this series on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUzkUm2opaA

For those wondering what steps I took, please see below (also found within that video as a step-by-step walkthrough).

* npm install @types/screeps
* npm install @types/lodash
* npm install @types/node
* npm install -g typescript

Configured the tsconfig.json and the VS Code settings to hide the .js and .js.map files (clutter).
